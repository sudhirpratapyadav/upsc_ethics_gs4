			- Royal Edicts - law as promulgated.
	- Manusmriti
		-  If one conducts a theft willingly and in full senses knowing the implications, he should be penalized 8 times that of ordinary thief if he is a Shudra.

In other words, **the punishment should be directly proportional to knowledge and social status of the criminal.**

This contrast of moral values is directly attributed to their parents.

- Arthashastra backs **rational ethic** to the conduct of the affairs of the state. The emphasis is on **systematisation of law** and **uniformity of law** throughout the empire.
- Concept of Welfare State
	-  Welfare in all areas. not just human well being, but also about animal welfare.
	- according to Kautilya, King is "ever engaged in advancing the welfare of the people and who endears himself by benefiting the public and doing right to them."

		5.  Treasury or _Kosha_ -- Finance
		6.  Punishment or _Danda_ -- Judiciary
		7.  Allies or _Mitra_ -- Foreign Policy
-  According to Kautilya, good governance consisted of **three basic elements**:
	- (1) Provision of **national security** and **public infrastructure**, such as roads to facilitate and promote commerce
	- (2) Formulation of **efficient** (farsighted and well thought-out) **policies** and their effective implementation, removal of all obstructions to economic growth and **tax incentives to encourage capital formation**, and
	- (3) Ensuring a **fair, caring and clean** administration. 
- Other aspects of Good Governance
	- _Arthashastra_ describes the **king as servant of state** who would harbour no personal likes and dislikes.
	- Kautilya stated that **good governance and stability go together.**
		- There is stability if rulers are **responsive**, **responsible**, **accountable** and **removable**, otherwise there would be instability.
	- Four methods were advocated for **settlement of disputes**
		- Sama (conciliation), Dama (appeasement), Bheda (dividing), and Danda (use of force) to be employed as last resort.
	- King to be held accountable for:
		- Achievement oriented behaviour in terms of well being, happiness and prosperity and security of subjects. judicious use of authority.
		- Pursuit of happiness of people.
		- Use of reason and experience as basis of decision.
		- Shirking of work to be identified and punished.
		- Designing appropriate **audit system to prevent corruption.**
		- Strength of character, intelligence, perseverance of civil servants.
		- Uprightness, friendliness and firmness of devotion in dealing with others.
- **4 Nitis to stop corruption**
	- **Saam** - Teaching and awaking public and public officials about **ethical values in the administration**, code of conduct, code of ethics etc.
	- **Daam** - Incentivising hard working officials, **recognising the honest people** and better salary structures, better working conditions and best service conditions. There should be a **grievance redressal** mechanism for both public and public officials.
	- **Dand** - Those who indulge in corrupt activities should get **punishment**. Punishments acts as deterrents and creates fear among the officials which results corruption becomes high risk activity but in India corruption is a low risk activity and high gain activity.
	- **Bhed** - **Vigilance, Intelligence and spy system** on those who going against rules, taking bribes, unaccounted money etc to be reported.

### Governance in Ramayana

- Duties of kings are
	- **make their subjects happy**
	- to **observe truth**
	- **protecting Dharma**
		- **Righteousness is called Dharma**. It is Dharma that restraints and limits all evil acts of men
	- **Devoting his life in service of his subjects**
	- Formation of good governance is Dharma.
	- King, ministers and employees who have taken oath of their offices to upholding Dharma and to **act in accordance with common good**, must not act unjustly or unethically so as to secure their private good through selfishness.

	- A **formal set of rules** and regulations
	- Well-defined **hierarchy** within the organization

### George Elton Mayo
- George Elton Mayo is popularly known as the father of Human Relation Theory of an Organisation
- ![mind_map_elton_mayo](https://github.com/sudhirpratapyadav/upsc_ethics_gs4/blob/main/mind_map_elton_mayo.png?raw=true)
- Hawthorne Experiments (Read once then remember titles)
	- **The Great Illumination**
		- Mayo first checked the assumption that the ‘better the light, the better the work’. To study the effects of altered illumination on work, he selected 2 groups of employees, called as control group, the lighting was kept at a fixed level, it was first increased in intensity in the other group and later on it was decreased. The results were dramatic as it was found that in the experimental group, the output showed an increase in all the cases. Moreover, it was seen that the output of the control group too registered an increase despite the fact that no lighting changes were made in it. It hence means that physical factors at work e.g. lighting had nothing to do with production beyond a certain level and the increase in output should be due to some unknown factor.
	- **The Relay Assembly Test Room Experiment**
		- In this group of six girls was selected. The group was initially constituted by first selecting 2 girls who were then asked to select 4 more girls of their choice. The group was employed in assembling telephone relays, which is a small but intricate electronic equipment, composed of nearly 40 separate parts. The group was subjected to various changes throughout the series of experiments, which lasted over a period of five years and an observer sat with the girls in the workshop noting any changes in the rate of production and keeping the girls informed about the experiment as well as asking for their advice or information and listening to their complaints. In short, he noted everything that went on in the relay assembly test room.
	- **Mass Interviewing Programme**
		- During the course of the experiment about 20,000 interviews were conducted to determine employees attitude towards their company, supervision, insurance plans, promotion and wages. Initially, the employees were questioned directly but later on realising the limitations of this approach, a questionnaire was prepared and circulated among the employees. The answers to these were analysed and it was realised that the social factors, both inside and outside the organisation affect the attitude of workers towards the work that they are doing. During the course of the mass interviews, it was also observed that the worker’s behaviour was being influenced by the group behaviour. This was reflected more so in terms of restricted output set up by the group norm. However, such observation could not be clearly verified in this stage of experiment and hence a detailed study of this aspect was carried out under shop situation to find out the behaviour of workers in small groups under the bank wiring room experiment.
	- **Bank Wiring Room Experiment**
		- Mayo noticed that the social groups formed in the factory workshop were capable of exercising considerable influence over the behaviour of their individual members. He hence decided to investigate the Bank Wiring Room, where he felt there was a great scope for improvement in output but he found that the output was restricted despite adequate financial incentives.


### Peter Drucker - Management Theory
- Peter Drucker believed that business leaders need to embrace the **“spirit of performance”** by displaying high levels of moral and ethical integrity in their actions, focusing on results, empowering employees, going beyond financial obligations to shareholders, and ultimately serving the common good.
