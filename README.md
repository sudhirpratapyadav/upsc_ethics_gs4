#### Justice
- Quote
	- "Stand up firmly for justice, as a witness to God, even as against yourselves or your parents or your kin, and whether it be against rich or poor" -- Quran (Surah 4:135)
		- Meaning justice is for all. Everyone should put justice first, even before their family.
	- "Justice in the life and conduct of the State is possible only as first it resides in the hearts and souls of the citizens." -- Plato
		- meaning justice starts from citizens and move towards states as opposed to current top-down view where Justice starts from state and trickle down to people via Judiciary.
- Definition
	- Arthsashtra
		- “A King who administers justice in accordance with ‘dharma’, evidence, customs, and written law will be able to conquer whole world” -- Arthsashtra, Kautilya
		- Kautilya prescribe that any matter of dispute shall be judged according to four bases of justice. These from most to least important are:
			- Dharma -  which is based on truth
			- Evidence - which is based on witnesses
			- Custom - tradition accepted by the people
			- Royal Edicts - law as promulgated.
	- Manusmriti
		-  If one conducts a theft willingly and in full senses knowing the implications, he should be penalized 8 times that of ordinary thief if he is a Shudra. The penalty should be 16 times if he is a Vaishya, 32 times if he is a Kshatriya and 64 times if he is a Brahmin. The punishment can be even 100 times or 128 times if he is a Brahmin. In other words, **the punishment should be directly proportional to knowledge and social status of the criminal.**
		- Thus contrary to popular perceptions, **The concept of immunity to MPs and Judges from impeachment and legal framework is against Manu Smriti.**
- Conclusion
	- Justice that love gives is a surrender, justice that law gives is a punishment. -- Mahatma Gandhi
		- Similar to Plato, focus on heart rather than law

		- Pandavas vs Kauravs - From childhood both Pandavs and Kauravs shared almost similar environment from home to school. They were taught by same gurus, mainly Dronacharya. Both were given similar facilities. Thus they were equally talented and skilled in all sphere's of life, but both developed opposite characters. Pandavas stood for dharma, while Kauravas for Adharma. This contrast of moral values is directly attributed to their parents.
		- Dhritarashtra jealousy, and Shakuni's deviousness directly transferred to Duryodhan who grew up observing both of them.
- Conclusion
	- "Children learn more from what you ARE than what you TEACH." -- W. E. B. DuBois
